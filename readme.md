# ScribbleDae
ScribbleDae is a simple 2D platformer game created using the Godot game engine. It features pixel art graphics and original sound effects generated using a custom addon. I created this Project to learn Godot 4.

# Gameplay
In ScribbleDae, the player controls a character through a series of levels, avoiding obstacles and enemies. The game features simple mechanics, including jumping, doublejumping, floating and running, making it easy to pick up and play.

# Graphics
ScribbleDae features pixel art graphics, all created by me. I am not an artist by any means, but creating pixel art is a soothing and creative activity I enjoy. 

# Installation
To play ScribbleDae, you'll need to download the Godot game engine (version 4.0 stable or later). Once you have Godot installed, simply clone the repository and open the project in Godot
